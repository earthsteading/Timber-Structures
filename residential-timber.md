Timber based structures, mass timber, cross laminated timber, 


## Terms, definitions and standards
 - [ ] Building Code of Australia, Building Act and Regulations as per the National Construction Code

 - [ ] AS 1684 Series: Timber construction for non-engineers including design, bracing, connection, installation, pitched roof, trusses (AS4440), floor joists, wall frame, footings, sub floor, etc.
 - [ ] AS 4055 (if greater than 8.5m ridge line) = wind speed
 - [ ] AS 1720 Series: Part 1 Timber structures design methods, Part 2 Timber properties, Part 3 Design criteria for timber framed residential buildings, Part 4 Fire resistance for timber, Part 5 nail-plated timber roof trusses
 - [ ] AS 4440 (2004) Installation of nailplated timber roof trusses.
 - [ ] Design certification required by an engineer, per state based regulation, e.g. Form 15 in QLD, Reg126 in Vic, 

# Checklist for checking timber structures (residential)

Surveyor List --> Check
 - [ ] Slab design
 - [ ] Steel beam layout / design from Engineer
 - [ ] Wall frame layout with panel identification
 
 Inspector Checks
   - [ ] post installation of walls and roof trusses
   - [ ] prior to roof being added
   - [ ]

## NCC2020 Changes to Timber Standards: 
  - [ ] sections of braced walls are to be treated as loadbearing
  - [ ] Noles/notchings limits of internal non-load bearing walls has been increased to 52mm or 50% of the stud depth.
  - [ ] Bracing design capacities for JD5, or higher capacity timbers
  - [ ] AS1170.2 Site wind speed for loading formula for calculating has changed including climate change variables for average wind speeds increasing.
  - [ ] Wind regions have been updated based on 20 years of recorded data.
  - [ ] Able to interpolate wind speed for cyclones as it goes inland, otherwise utilise AS4055 for under 8.5m or AS1170.2 for ridge lines over 8.5m.
  - [ ] Terrain category, e.g. TC1 to TC3 = objects likes trees able to buffer wind speed.  Most residential is TC2.5
  - [ ] Topography defined by AS4055 Table 2.4, wind speed increases as it goes up the slope of the hill.
 
# Timber truss checking
  - [ ] Reference standards: AS 1684 + AS 4440
  - [ ] Surveying and inspection checks:
  - [ ] Roof layout with bracing members and Producer statement report with roof sheet and ceiling weight, battons/centres, wind speed, eave/ridge height and full list of connection and tie-down details.
  - [ ] Truss design sheet with profile elevation and design spacing with notes for consideration like top chords, etc.
  - [ ] Product range details for installation of timber products, e.g. joist hangers, etc.
  - [ ] Check girder trusses first which are carrying the weight of the jacks, hips creepers and additional trusses.  Most heavy load so no girder splicing!
  - [ ] Truss orientation for internal load bearing walls, e.g. trusses can be installed in reverse.
  - [ ] Check: damaaged or missing nail plates, plates not fully engaged because of weathering so plate pulls away.
  - [ ] Check: damaged or cracked members from movement or with services cutting through to install ducting, etc.
  - [ ] Check: Web ties aka T stiffiners
  - [ ] Check: Batten fixing on roof for attaching tiles/slates/etc.
  - [ ] Check jack truses must be fixed to the HTC
  - [ ] Check tursses are straight/plumb, not bowed, not out more than 20-50mm from top to bottom.
  - [ ] Check: internal wall brackets, fixing should be at the middle to top of slots to allow trusses to deflect.
  - [ ] Check: speed bracing should be criss-crossed and terminating with hip ends, esp for gabled.
  - [ ] Bracing bays on gable ends not above 13m span.
  - [ ] Splice fixing should be wrapped around top chord, not lapse spliced.
  - [ ] End fixing of speed bracing can be braced with a compresssion block as per Figure 4.23
  - [ ] bracing around box guttters require additional bracing.
  - [ ] parapets should have factory fitted claw plate to connect it to the truss.
  - [ ] Bottom chord restraints provided for plasterboard fixing.
  - [ ] Truss to truss connections should be documented with fixtures and nails required schedule.
  - [ ] Truss tie down connections to be checked for kPa and should be listed with uplift value and what is required to resist uplift.
  - [ ] AS 1684 Table 9.14 + 9.25 = tie down requirements.

Prefabricated wall frames
  - [ ] Documentation prior to inspection: (1) Wall frame layout, (2) Wall panel IDs schedule, (3) Wall frame elements via engineering software or AS 1684.
  - [ ] Check: (a) notches made by service technicians into studs/trusses which weaken the frame, (b) tie down fixings as per table 9.2 (nominal fixings) to assure wind uplift is accounted for especially for sheet roof vs tile or other heavier roof, (c) continuity of tie down fixings as per manufactuer proprietary specification: from roof sheeting to trusses to wall frame to the floor to the slab, (d) slab wall fixings, like ramset anchor screws - be aware of slab depth for waffle, (e) 
  - [ ] Wall bracing = area of elevation x Roof pitch and wind speed (Table 8.2) = kPa <-- ceiling diaphragm direct wind to bracing walls.  Depth of ceiling diaphragm is dictated by Table 8.20.  Bracing walls face the wind direction and are made with particle board and plaster board with fixings to the slab, e.g. bracing walls less than 2.4m2 require significant kPa tie downs.  Shear blocks used to connect ceiling/wall into trusses without direct fixing to truss (Table 8.22).
  - [ ] For second storey buildings bridging cleats and I-joists must be checked.
  - [ ] Durability via Appendix B: (a) in ground vs weather exposed, etc. (b) natural durability class for each type of timber or via preservative treatment, (c) internal fixtures galvanised to Z275, (d) HDG or stainless steel required for external, e.g. post anchors.
